## What's this?

MVICore is a modern, Kotlin-based MVI framework:
- **Scaling with complexity**: operate with a single Reducer if needed, with the option of having the full power of additional components to handle more complex cases
- **Event handling**: A solution to handling events that you donâ€™t want to store in the state
- **Reactive component binding**: A super simple API to bind your reactive endpoints to each other with automatic lifecycle handling
- **Custom Middlewares**: for every single component in the system, with flexible configuration options
- **Logger**: An out-of-the-box logger Middleware
- **Time Travel Debugger**: for ALL of your reactive components (not just your state machine!) with UI controls for recording and playback


## Documentation

The library comes with lots of powerful capabilities and tooling.

See [https://badoo.github.io/MVICore/](https://badoo.github.io/MVICore) for full documentation.

## Download

Available through jitpack.

Add the maven repo to your root `build.gradle`

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependencies:
- Framework:
```groovy

```

- Helper classes for Android:
```groovy
implementation 'com.github.badoo.mvicore:mvicore-android:{latest-version}'
```

- Time Travel Debugger controls in a [DebugDrawer](https://github.com/palaima/DebugDrawer) module (You need to add the dependencies to DebugDrawer and configure it yourself before you can use this):
```groovy
