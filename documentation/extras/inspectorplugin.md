## Android Studio plugin to observe elements of connections

!!! note
    This plugin is still under development (**requires MVICore 1.2.0 or later**)

Allows to record elements passed through middlewares and inspect their values.

### How to use
1. Download [MVICoreInspector.zip](https://github.com/badoo/MVICore/blob/master/mvicore-plugin/idea/artifacts/MVICoreInspector.zip?raw=true)
2. Inside the IDE go to "Install plugin from disk..."
3. Install the .zip file and restart the IDE
4. Add plugin middleware artifact to your dependencies: `implementationÂ "com.github.badoo.mvicore:mvicore-plugin-middleware:$VERSION"`
5. Setup middleware configuration:
    ```kotlin
    // Create store
    val store = DefaultPluginStore(BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID)
    
    // Apply middleware
    Middlewares.configurations.add(
         MiddlewareConfiguration(
             condition = WrappingCondition.Always,
             factories = listOf(
                 { consumer -> IdeaPluginMiddleware(consumer, store) }
             )
         )
    )
    ```
6. Connect device, so it is visible to the IDE.
7. Press Run icon in the MVICore panel.

The pane contains three sections:

- Left - List of events passed through middlewares.
- Right top - List of active connections. You can filter events by selecting connections.
- Right bottom - Currently selected event from the left part. Displays event data and connection it was sent from.
